# Example scenario as a test
For now this package contains only one test case:
[SimpleDomainTest](SimpleDomainTest.java).

Next to testing the code, it also provides an use-case example for the framework.

Some explanation on this can be nicely provided in this readme file.

## Running the test
To run the test just enter on the commandline in the project's root directory: mvn test
